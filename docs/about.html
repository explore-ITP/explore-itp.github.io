          <h2>EeShan Bhatt</h2>
          <h3>MIT-WHOI PhD Candidate Mentor</h3>
          <p>EeShan graduated from Duke University in 2015 with a B.S.E in Mechanical Engineering and is a PhD Candidate at the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. His research focus is on anticipating the physically-driven and stochastic uncertainties behind vertial sound speed structure that predicates autonomous underwater vehicle communication, navigation, and sampling. A welcome but unexpected part of this thesis work is designing tools and interactive data visualizations.</p>
