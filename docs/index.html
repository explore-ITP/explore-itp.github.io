      <h2 class="subtitle">Geographic Context</h2>
        <p>The Arctic Ocean is a mystery. Located on the North Pole, what we claim to know about this elusive body of water is based on a sparse amount of knowledge due to its remoteness and hostile climate. Within the Arctic Ocean lies the Beaufort Gyre, an ice and water circulation pattern that moves in a clockwise direction. As it spins, the gyre accumulates fresh water that enters the Ocean from melting sea ice and glaciers, along with river runoff from nearby land masses of North America and Asia. This naturally occurring cycle affects the properties of the Ocean.</p>  
        <p>Which ocean properties could this affect, and how?</p>
                  
        <p>Previous scientists have shown us that the air, the ice, and the oceans are interconnected. And in the age of climate change, understanding the Ocean is important in developing our responses to a changing climate.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Profile Deployment</h2> 
        <p>The large amount of ice covering its surface makes conventional methods of sampling the water particularly difficult. Scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) designed a solution to this challenge of collecting Arctic Ocean data - a new measuring device called the Ice Tethered Profiler (ITP).</p>

        <p>The systemâ€™s top portion sits on the surface of the ice, and a long wire rope extends through the ice, down into the water, and through the water column. The component that actually conducts the sampling moves up and down along the wire, collecting measurements. This data is then sent in real-time to WHOI via a satellite link, now accessible for exploration and analysis.</p>
        
        <p>What could they be collecting? Hover over the ITP to the right to find out.</p>
                       
        <p>Since the first deployments in the early 2000s, a large amount of data has been collected. This data spans the thousands of observations each of over 100 machines, and many are still out on the ice, actively collecting information. This database is growing continuously, and along with it is our understanding of the Arctic Ocean and its secrets.</p>
