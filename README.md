## Welcome to our Repo

Our team was formed this summer in the wake of COVID-19, through the *Duke Keep Exploring* initiative. Duke University reached out to alumni to create projects for students whose summer opportunities were displaced. This data exploration project is a direct consequence of this pairing. The team members are:

1. **Eeshan Bhatt** - PhD Candidate at MIT-WHOI Joint Program  - Duke BSE '15
2. **Lara Breitkreutz** - Data Story Development Intern - Environmental Science w/ Certificate in Documentary Studies BS '20
3. **Alexandra Rivera** - Data Science Intern - Civil and Environmental Engineering, anticipated BSE '23

You can learn more about us on our *GitHub website*(https://explore-itp.github.io)

## How to use this Repo

In our data notebooks you can find our code. We guide users through step by step data processing and visualization. We leave empty space to code after each visualization for those interested in manipulation. Our data notebooks can be opened in Google CoLab:

## About the Data

We used a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) Ice Tethered Profiler (ITP) dataset. ITP's sit on the surface of the ice, and a long wire rope extends through the ice, down into the water, and through the water column. The sampling component moves up and down along the wire, collecting measurements. This data is then sent in real-time to WHOI via a satellite link.

Created in 2002 and expanding, this dataset is composed of physical characteristic measurements from the Arctic Ocean - depth, salinity, and temperature. Our team used two formats of the data, Level 1 Raw Data and Level 3 Archive Data. A more extensive description of the data, along with data processing and documentation information, can be found [**here.**](https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=23096)
